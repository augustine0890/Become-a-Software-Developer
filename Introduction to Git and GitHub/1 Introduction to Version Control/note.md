- The git directory contains all the changes and their history and the working tree contains the current versions of the files.
- The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in Git and the working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the files.

- Staging area (index): a file maintained by Git that contains all of the information about what files and changes are going to go into your next commit.
- We need to stage the file, so that the changes will be included in the next commit (After modifying a file, we need to stage those changes and then commit them afterwards).

- Commit Message: a short description of the change (up to 50 characters), followed by one or more paragraphs giving more details of the change (if needed)
